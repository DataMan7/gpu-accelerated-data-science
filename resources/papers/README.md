- Climate modeling and HPC

## Contribution Guidelines

When adding papers to this directory:

1. **File Naming**: Use format `YYYY_Author_ShortTitle.pdf` or `.md`
2. **Metadata**: Include paper metadata (title, authors, venue, year, DOI)
3. **Summaries**: Provide brief summaries or key findings
4. **Licensing**: Ensure papers are legally shareable or provide links to official sources
